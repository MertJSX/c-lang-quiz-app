# Quiz app with C language
## Introduction
Tested on Windows 10! If you want to run the program on Linux, I don't tested it before on Linux, which means maybe you can get errors.
## Creating exe file of program
First of all, you should have a C-language compiler like GCC or MinGW. If you already have a compiler, run the following command:<br><br>
```gcc -o quiz-app quiz-app.c```<br><br>
And you can run the program :)<br><br>
